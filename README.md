# 📊 Advanced Profit Bridge Model in DAX (Normative Decomposition)

Welcome to this repository. Here you will find an analytical model developed in **Power BI with DAX**, designed to audit and explain a company's profitability variations with exact mathematical precision.

## 🎯 What is this project about?
When a company's profits go up or down between two periods, executives need to know exactly *why*. Traditionally, analysts build "Profit Bridges" that often leave margins of error or unexplained "cross-terms".

This model applies the **Normative Decomposition** postulated by Dr. Tim J. Smith in his scientific publication *"Normative decomposition of the profit bridge into the impact of changes in marketing variables" (2021)*. 

The magic of this approach lies in using inter-period averages to perfectly isolate the impact of four key variables, without leaving a single cent unexplained:

* **📈 Volume Impact (QI):** How much money we gained/lost by selling more or fewer units.
* **🏷️ Price Impact (PI):** The pure effect of our price increases or decreases.
* **⚙️ Variable Cost Impact (VI):** Operational efficiency when reducing or increasing costs.
* **🔀 Mix Effect (MI):** How the change in the proportion of sold products impacted overall profitability (e.g., selling more of the high-margin products).
